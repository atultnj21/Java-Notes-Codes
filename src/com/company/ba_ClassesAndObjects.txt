/*
classes and objects
-------------------

A CLASS is a blueprint or template for creating objects.

for example we can have class called car
and in this class we define everything we need to
know about a car

car(attributes/fields)
started
currentSpeed
currentGear
car(behaviour/Methods)
start()
stop()
brake()
changeGear()

when we call these methods the state of car changes
for ex:- when we call the changeGear method value of
the currentGear field changes
so this car class is a template or blue print
for creating objects

An OBJECT is an instance of a class.

based on this template we can create many instances
like car1,car2,car3 these objects will have the same
fields and methods,but they are independent of each other
each car object will get a separate space in the memory
and in a separate state.data in each car object can be different

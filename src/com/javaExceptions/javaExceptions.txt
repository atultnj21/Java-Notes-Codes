An exception is an object that contains information about an error

In java we have three kinds of exceptions

Checked
Java compiler enforces us to handle these errors that is why
they are called checked exceptions because they get checked at
compile time
ex:FileReader  :  FileNotFoundException


Unchecked/ runtime exception
these exceptions are not checked by the compilers,they occur
due to programming errors
ex:NullPointerException
ex:ArithmeticException -> if you try to divide a value by 0
ex:illegalArgumentException
ex:indexOutOfBoundsException

Error
indicates error external to our application
ex:stackoverflow
ex:outOfMemory

   Hashing is technique to convert a range of key values into
   range of indices

   ex: take an array of size 10
   add numbers into array 72,39,11,18
   default insertion will make searching difficult
   hashing helps us here, hashing uses a hash function
   let's say f(x) = x%10
   x   f(x)/indices
   72  2
   39  9
   11  1
   18  8
   21  1 -> hash collision

   one solution to this hash collision problem is open addressing
   i.e. leave some empty spaces in your array.
   another solution is chaining
   suppose we have same indices for two elements we will
   make that point a linked list containing both the elements

   the arrays here we use are called hash tables
